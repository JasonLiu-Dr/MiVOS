# Modular Interactive Video Object Segmentation: Interaction-to-Mask, Propagation and Difference-Aware Fusion (MiVOS)

[[Project Page]](https://hkchengrex.github.io/MiVOS/)

## Introduction

We present Modular interactive VOS (MiVOS) framework which has three components: interaction-to-mask, mask propagation, and difference-aware fusion. It is interaction-efficient, user-friendly, and can adapt to any interaction interaction-to-mask algorithms without fine-tuning.

Code and data will be released later.
